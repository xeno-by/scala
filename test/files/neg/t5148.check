t5148.scala:4: error: missing or invalid dependency while loading 'value scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.Imports.sym' in class file 'Imports.class'.
Already compiled 'value scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.Imports.sym' requires access to term memberHandlers in class scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.IMain.
Make sure that term memberHandlers is in your classpath and check for conflicting dependencies with `-Ylog-classpath`.
A full rebuild may help if 'Imports.class' was compiled against an incompatible version of scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.IMain.
class IMain extends Imports

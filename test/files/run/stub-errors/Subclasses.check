error: newSource1.scala:3: missing or invalid dependency while loading 'constructor stuberrors.B.<init>' in class file 'B.class'.
Already compiled 'constructor stuberrors.B.<init>' requires access to type A in package stuberrors.
Make sure that type A is in your classpath and check for conflicting dependencies with `-Ylog-classpath`.
A full rebuild may help if 'B.class' was compiled against an incompatible version of stuberrors.
    class C extends B
